# rapidlib-machine-learning-examples

A repository of machine learning examples written in C++ using the rapidlib and other libraries.

I created this repo as a standalone repo that you should be able to compile without neededing any other stuff. 

RapidLib was created by various folks in the EU funded RapidMix project which involved Goldsmiths and IRCAM amongst others. 

I did not work on that project directly, but do work closely with folks involved in it 

Here are some links about RapidLib/ Mix:

It uses cmake for the build system. 

The files in the lib folder are written by other people. Here is a list of the authors:
